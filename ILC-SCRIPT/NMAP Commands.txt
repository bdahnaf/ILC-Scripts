Working Sequence:
1. download link - https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.70-setup.exe
2. Install by the default choices
3. Open cmd at the installed location. Default is C:\Program Files (x86)\Nmap
4. Run one of the commands above. It will save the output to D:\ directory.

* Also works with the firewall on.
* -v parameter will show the output of UP+DOWN hosts.
* Omit -v to get only the active or UP hosts.
* nmap.bat will run only on the C:\Program Files (x86)\Nmap directory.
* add "cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Nmap" to the 2nd line of the batch file to run it from anywhere.
	But in this case the file should be run as administrator. (nmap-admin.bat)
